Delete Data

Removing data from Splunk is possible by using the delete command. 
We first create the search condition to fetch the events we want to mark for delete. 
Once the search condition is acceptable, we add the delete clause at the end of the command to remove those events
from Splunk. After deletion, not even a user with admin privilege is able to view this data in Splunk.

Removal of data is irreversible. If you still want the removed data back into Splunk then you 
should have the original source data copy with you which can be used to re-index the data in Splunk. 
It will be a process similar to creating a new index.

Assigning Delete Privilege
Any user including admin user does not have access to delete the data by default. 
By default, only the "can_delete" role has the ability to delete events. 
So, we create a new user, assign this role and then login with the credentials of this 
new user to perform the delete operation.

New user created : settings > users > new user 
                   name:todeluser
                   can_delete 

Then login as new user.
for example from our past queries :

in search bar > source="syslog" host="ApplSysLog" index="application_log" sourcetype="syslog" | delete
              > index=* host=HP_Appl_Log | delete

Login back as admin and check if data exists
