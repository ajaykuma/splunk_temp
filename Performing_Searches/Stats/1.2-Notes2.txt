Data Model acceleration:
--------------
Data model acceleration is a tool that you can use to speed up data models that represent extremely large datasets. 
After acceleration, pivots based on accelerated data model datasets complete quicker than they did before, 
as do reports and dashboard panels that are based on those pivots.

Data model acceleration does this with the help of the High Performance Analytics Store functionality, 
which builds data summaries behind the scenes in a manner similar to that of report acceleration. 
Like report acceleration summaries, data model acceleration summaries are easy to enable and disable, 
and are stored on your indexers parallel to the index buckets that contain the events that are being summarized.

This is how data model acceleration differs from report acceleration and summary indexing:

Report acceleration and summary indexing speed up individual searches, on a report by report basis. 
	They do this by building collections of precomputed search result aggregates.
Data model acceleration speeds up reporting for the entire set of fields that you define in a data model 
	and which you and your Pivot users want to report on. In effect it accelerates the dataset represented by 
	that collection of fields rather than a particular search against that dataset.

High performance analytics store:
Data model acceleration summaries are composed of multiple time-series index files, which have the .tsidx file extension. 
Each .tsidx file contains records of the indexed field::value combos in the selected dataset and all of the index locations 
of those field::value combos. It's these .tsidx files that make up the high-performance analytics store. Collectively, 
the .tsidx files are optimized to accelerate a range of analytical searches involving the set of fields defined in the accelerated data model.
